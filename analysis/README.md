# Analyze Phase | Requirements Across Modules Five–Seven

**Project sequence:** [Start Here](../README.md) → **M5 Analyze** →
[M5 Design](../design/README.md) →
[M6 Construct/Test Prototype](../prototype/README.md) →
[M7 Construct](../src/README.md) → [M7 Test](../tests/README.md)

## Purpose

Analysis asks **what the system must do** before you decide how to design or
code it.

The IT 140 text-game project spans three graded activities. The current
Guidelines and Rubric for each activity is the official source of requirements.
The [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](text_based_game_srs.md)
reorganizes those requirements by checkpoint so you can see what stays the same
and what changes as the project develops.

## The Requirements Grow Across Three Modules

| Module | Question to answer | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | What complete game are you proposing, and how should its two main command processes work? | Project One design |
| 6 | Can you translate the movement idea into a small working Python prototype? | Movement milestone |
| 7 | Can you integrate your complete design into a working, tested game? | Project Two final program |

The Module Six sample does not replace your Project One game requirements. It
reduces the problem temporarily so you can practice construction and testing.

## Module Five | Initial Analysis

Use:

* Project One Guidelines and Rubric in D2L Brightspace
* Sample Dragon Text Game supporting materials
* [Text-Based Game SRS](text_based_game_srs.md), Section 1

Identify the following before designing:

### Game Goal and World

* What must the player collect to win?
* What causes the player to lose?
* What is the minimum number of rooms?
* What is the minimum number of items?
* Which rooms may not contain items?
* What must be true about the map so the game can be won?

### Commands and Program Behavior

The final game needs two command families:

1. **Move between rooms** using north, south, east, or west.
2. **Get an item** from the current room.

For each process, identify:

* Input the player provides
* Validation that must occur
* Decisions the program must make
* Output the player receives
* What behavior repeats

Do not begin with Python syntax. Project One grades the **design**.

## Module Six | Reanalyze the Reduced Scope

Before coding the milestone, return to the requirements and deliberately reduce
the scope.

The milestone includes:

* The provided three-room dragon dictionary
* Current-room output
* Movement commands
* `exit`
* A gameplay loop
* Decision branching
* Input validation
* Debugging and readable code

The milestone intentionally excludes:

* Your Project One room map
* Items and inventory
* A villain
* Final win/loss logic

This reduced scope is a development strategy, not a change to your final game
design.

## Module Seven | Reanalyze Before Integration

Before Project Two, review:

* Project One design files and instructor feedback
* Module Six code and instructor feedback
* Project Two Guidelines and Rubric
* Project Two supporting flowchart/output materials
* [Text-Based Game SRS](text_based_game_srs.md), Section 3

Ask:

* Which Project One design decisions become data in the final dictionary?
* Which movement ideas from the milestone can be reused or adapted?
* Which milestone-only behaviors must be removed or replaced?
* What additional behavior is required for items, inventory, functions,
  winning, and losing?

## Analyze Checkpoint

Before continuing, you should be able to explain this traceability path:

> **Requirements → Project One design → Module Six prototype experience →
> Project Two implementation → testing evidence**

You should also be able to distinguish **course-provided sample data** from
**your own final game data**.
